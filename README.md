Based on geological exploration data, the mission entails identifying the optimal sites for drilling 200 new oil wells in three distinct areas. The objective is to determine the area with the highest potential profit and use a linear regression model to forecast the volume of reserves in these new wells. To do this, the data must be divided into training and validation sets. A model must then be trained, and predictions must be made for every region. The top 200 wells' profits are then calculated, and a risk analysis is carried out using bootstrapping to determine the possible profit and the probability of losses. The region with the highest average profit and a loss risk of less than 2.5 percent is chosen for the project.
